My HackerRank solutions in Python with a focus on Algorithms, Data Structures, Mathematics, and AI/ML challenges.

# HackerRank Solutions – AI Engineering Focus

This repository contains my solutions to various [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) challenges.  
The solutions are written primarily in **Python** and cover topics like:

- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Mathematics & Probability
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning challenges

The goal is to showcase problem-solving skills relevant to **AI Engineering** roles.

## Repository Structure
- `python/algorithms/` – classic algorithm problems
- `python/data-structures/` – arrays, linked lists, stacks, etc.
- `python/ai/` – ML & statistics problems
- `notebooks/` – detailed AI/ML problem explanations in Jupyter Notebooks
